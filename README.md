Our project is a user-friendly To-Do List application built with Node.js and Mongoose. Users can create customized To-Do Lists of their own names by simply typing a unique URL(Example:- https://localhost:3000/Work 
 -> This creates a todoList named Work). Key features include:

Effortless Task Management: Add and delete tasks with ease.
Dynamic List Creation: Instantly create unique lists with unique URLs.
Robust Database Integration: Secure and reliable data storage using MongoDB.
Intuitive User Interface: Simple and clear design for easy task management.
Responsive and Accessible: Works seamlessly across devices.
